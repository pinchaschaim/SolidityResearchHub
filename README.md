## Smart Contracts Overview

This repository contains the following smart contracts for analysis:

- `ExampleContract.sol`: A simple contract to demonstrate the research process.
- Additional smart contracts will be added as the research progresses.

## Analysis Tools

The following tools are used for analyzing the smart contracts:

- [Slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither): Static analysis framework for Solidity.
- [Mythril](https://github.com/ConsenSys/mythril): Security analysis tool for Ethereum smart contracts.
- [Foundry](https://github.com/gakonst/foundry): A blazing fast, portable, and modular toolkit for Ethereum application development written in Rust.
- [Solhint](https://protofire.github.io/solhint/): Linter for Solidity code.

## Setup Instructions

To set up the environment for analyzing the smart contracts, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/pinchaschaim/SolidityResearchHub.git
   cd SolidityResearchHub
```

2. Install Dependencies:
Ensure you have the necessary tools installed. For example, you can install Slither with pip:

```sh
pip install slither-analyzer
```
Follow the official documentation for each tool for installation instructions.

3. Configure Environment:
If you are using tools that require configuration, set them up according to their documentation.

Usage

Running Analysis

1. Static Analysis with Slither:

```sh

slither .
```
2. Security Analysis with Mythril:

```sh
myth analyze contracts/ExampleContract.sol
```
3. Fuzz Testing with Foundry:

```sh
forge test
```
4. Linting with Solhint:

```sh
solhint contracts/**/*.sol
```

Example Commands

Here are some example commands to help you run the tools and analyze the smart contracts:

Slither
To perform static analysis on all contracts in the repository:

```sh
slither .
```
Mythril
To perform a security analysis on a specific contract, such as ExampleContract.sol:

```sh
myth analyze contracts/ExampleContract.sol
```
Foundry
To run fuzz tests on the smart contracts using Foundry:

```sh
forge test
```
Solhint
To lint all Solidity files in the contracts directory:

```sh
solhint contracts/**/*.sol
```
